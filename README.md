<strong>Description:</strong> GoalTracker is an application that allows users to set and track personal goals in order to remain productive and motivated. It can be difficult to remember the plethora of high-achieving goals you would like to complete, that is where GoalTracker comes in. With a (few) click(s) of a button(s), you can create, update, complete your goals AND.. add a reward. While this application cannot hand you a physical reward, you can create your own reward to give to yourself.
